# Object_Detection_Using_Yolo
Object detection using the YOLO (You Only Look Once) algorithm is a popular deep-learning approach that allows for real-time, efficient, and accurate detection of multiple objects in an image or video stream. YOLOv7.cfg and YOLOv3.weights are specific configurations and pre-trained weights for two versions of the YOLO algorithm.
